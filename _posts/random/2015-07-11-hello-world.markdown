I have been working in the web development industry for quite a time now. Often are the times when I am working on some feature and I feel to read through related articles/blogs. They help me understand the pros and cons of doing things a certain way. I prefer to ascertain things before deep diving into the code. Such resources prove to be really helpful.

### Its time to give back

Yes! Through this blog, I will post my experiences on breaking and building things. That is one solid reason to start this blog.

So watch out for my next posts.<br>
Until then,<br>
Cheers!
